SQL ->Structured Query Language / Query Based Language
Types of Commands in SQL:
->DDL - Data Definition Language ->create, alter,drop
->DML - Data Manipulation Language ->insert , update , delete

DBMS->SQL->mysql,SQL server…
Why we need DBMS?

//Creating Database->
create database studentTable;

//using database
Use studentTable;

//How to create Table
Create table <tableName>
(
Id int,
Name char(20),
Address varchar(500)
);

//we want to delete our entire table
drop <tablename>;

CHAR - fixed length ,loss of extra memory space
VARCHAR - variable , there is no wastage of memory space

//Inserting data into Table
Insert into <tablename> values (101,”RAM”,”DWARKA”);
Insert into <tablename> values (102,”Shyam”,”Uttam Nagar”);
//how to view table(desc->describe)
desc <tablename>; 

#find/Select the name of student whose roll no is 101.
Select name from studentTable where id=101;

#find/Select all the details of student whose roll no is greater than 101.
Select * from studentTable where id > 101

#display the record of the students whose name startswith ‘a’
Select * from student where name like “a%”

Select name from students where marks > 80 and/or name like “a%”

//UPDATE COMMAND->DML

update <tableName> set name=“Shyam” where name=“ram” 

//ALTER COMMAND - DDL
Alter table <tablename>
Drop column address;


Alter table <tablename> 
Add Address varchar(1000);


Alter table <tablename>
Modify column name varchar(20);

#Delete command
Delete from <tablename> where <condition>


Length->
Select LENGTH(“SAHIL”)
->5
Select UPPER(“sahil”)
->SAHIL



select LENGTH("SAHIL");
select UCASE("sahil");
select UPPER("sahil");
select TRIM("        sahil     ")
select LTRIM("         sahil          ");
select RTRIM("         sahil          ");

STRCMP
Select STRCMP("MxSQL","MZSQL")

If str1 == str2 , ans->0
If str1 < str2,ans ->-1
If str1 > str2 ,ans ->1


String Substring 
select SUBSTRING("RAM VERMA",1,3);
select SUBSTRING("RAM VERMA",5,8);
select REVERSE("RAM VERMA");

REPLACING STRING
select REPLACE("RAM VERMA","VERMA","SHARMA");
